# For Mermaid AI - Simple Workflow

Create a flowchart for an Adaptive Learning Platform:

**Main Flow:**
1. Login → Dashboard (shows completion %, sessions, limits)
2. Create Session → Upload file → Study
3. End Session → AI generates test (20-25 questions)
4. Take Test → Camera monitoring → Submit
5. Get Results → Email sent → Weak topics identified
6. View Recommendations → YouTube/Articles suggested

**Key Rules:**
- Max 3 sessions per day
- Tests expire in 6 hours
- Weak topics = <70% score
- Browser extension tracks tabs

**Decision Points:**
- Can create session? (Check limits & pending tests)
- Test expired? (6 hours passed?)
- Weak topics found? (Score <70%)
